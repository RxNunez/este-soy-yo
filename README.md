## Description

This program is to paint a picture of an individual developers struggles to stay ahead in their current development environment. Since this developer has found that multiple sources of information is best for a developer, as placing stock in only one venue can be detrimental to developing the skills needed to succeed; the treehouse platform of information has been tapped as a secondary resource. Most of the struggle in setting up the Android SDK was getting and setting up the drivers for a live android product instead of an emulator, but the reward of seeing the small app live on a personal device was rewarding. The emulator however was much quicker responding. Next area of research will be speeding up the process.
